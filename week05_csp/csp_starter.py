Australian map colouring: six regions and three colours.

Tasks
-----
0. Examine an invalid assignment.
1. Understand variables, domains and constraints.
2. Implement constraint checking.
3. Implement backtracking with simple variable selection.
4. Compare backtracking with brute force.
5. Improve variable selection using MRV.
